# Space-Between
A 2 week Rapid Prototyping project at FIEA (Fall 2015) on the theme of 'storytelling'.

The game is set in space, where you and one other astronaut are casually space walking near your station. Things go south when the station is destroyed due to an unknown event. Recovering from the shock of what happened, you now have to make the decision of whether to desert your incapacitated partner and head for the escape pod with the limited oxygen you have left, or try and save him and bring him back to the pod with you.

The story follows a tell-a-tale structure where the standed astonaut tries to pursuade you to save him. The response you choose will either agitate him (thus making his oxygen consumption a lot faster) or it will calm him down, giving you ample time to get him to the escape pod before either of you runs out of oxygen.
