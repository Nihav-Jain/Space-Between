A2: Aren't you sick of looking at that thing yet?
A2: It looks exactly the same as the day we got here.
A2: Come On, let's get back to work.

A2: Helloooo! Did you forget what we came out here to do?
A2: I’m only literally hanging by a string.
A2: Fine, let me remind you. Take me over to that console.

A2: [Singing] I've got the world on a string,
A2: [Singing] sittin on a rainbow,
A2: [Singing] Got the string around my finger,
A2: [Singing] What a world, what a life, I’m in love!
A2: [Humming]

A2: Finally!  For a minute I thought you had reverted 
A2: back to the first day of training and all was doomed.

A2: Thanks. Do a quick circle around the station. 
A2: make sure everything's in tip top shape while I take care of this.
